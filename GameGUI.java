/**
 * This class represents a Game Board for an Escape Room game.
 * It initializes the game frame, renders the player, walls, traps, 
 * and prizes on the grid. It also manages player movements and score tracking.
 * 
 * Main features:
 * - Move the player on the grid while avoiding traps and walls.
 * - Collect prizes for points.
 * - Avoid penalties for hitting walls or going off-grid.
 * - Track player steps and overall performance.
 * - Support multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
